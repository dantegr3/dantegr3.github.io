        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recent launch of llander.org, we stand
        at a crossroad as to the future of this website. I think that The
        Piedmont LowLander should also serve as an aggregator of student
        submitted literature: poems, fiction, translations, etc.<br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the inclusion of student literature
        should be considered is that, as to my knowledge, there exist no such
        place for student submitted literature in Piedmont High School, and that
        it might be beneficial to foster a literary environment.<br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my thoughts and opinions would amount
        to nothing, if no writers nor students were interested in submitting
        literature, for this reason this article calls for all writers and
        students to submit literature to llander.org[1]<br /><br />

        End Notes:<br /><br />
        1. As of time of writing there was is no method of submitting or
        contacting due to the early nature of the website.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 22nd an Instagram account named
        “piedmontprotectors” was created to post “anonymous reports of
        assaulters, attackers, harassers, abusers and r*pists on piedmont
        campuses” (Instagram.com). The piedmontprotectors account is a spin-off
        of other similar accounts that have recently been popping up at high
        schools nationwide. The Piedmont account’s first three posts clarify the
        purpose of the account and the guidelines for participating. The
        following 68 posts (as of July 26), all consist of a trigger warning and
        a typed description of a survivor’s account, often taken directly from
        Instagram’s direct messaging system. Initially, the account received
        submissions through a Google Form but this was quickly removed as many
        people submitted things not relevant to the account to subvert the
        submission process, while shielded by the anonymity provided by Google
        Forms. <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The drama began when a story was posted of a
        description of an account of sexual harassment involving two Piedmont
        Highschool boys (We will refer to them as “John” and “Stephen”, not to
        protect the boys but to protect this publication from threats). This
        post included photos of John and Stephen’s Instagram accounts and the
        comments were quickly swarmed with angered students calling for Piedmont
        High to take action against the assaulters. This post was soon taken
        down and replaced with one that did not include photos of the two boys’
        Instagram accounts, piedmontprotectors cited being “threatened with
        legal action” as the reason for reposting. This second post still
        included the real names of the boys and was replaced with a third post
        which whited out the two names. Another survivor's account was soon
        posted, describing actions taken by these two boys on the same night as
        the previously described assault. The survivor writes of a horrific
        experience that involved multiple illegal, indecent, and despicable
        actions taken by the two boys as they coerced two girls to come over to
        one of their houses, continually harassing and physically assaulting the
        girls throughout the night. <br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to these posts, one of the parents
        of the two boys confronted the admins of the piedmontprotectors account
        and “threatened legal action for slander and defamation”
        (piedmontprotectors) while also citing cyberbullying as an issue with
        the account. Both online slander and defamation are real things a person
        can be sued for, however, according to harvard.org, this attack falls
        flat if the defendant can either prove that what they said was true or
        if what they said was simply their opinion. According to the government
        agency of “Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Planning
        and Evaluation”, legally consent is something that must be acquired from
        any parties involved in a sexual act. Thus, if these families were to
        sue the accuser(s), the accuser(s) would simply have to point out that
        they did not give consent, leaving the burden of proof resting on the
        two boys (cornell.edu). While this threat is empty, it speaks to the
        immense amount of privilege many members of the Piedmont community hold.
        These wealthy families were willing to further terrify sexual assault
        survivors and possibly take them to court simply to preserve their high
        standing in the community and to protect their children from their own
        detestable actions.<br /><br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 26th of July, an account by the name of
        “phsmaleprotectors” was created with the purpose of “stopping the false
        rape and harassment allegations against men by telling their sides of
        the story". Their first post is an image taken from a change.org
        petition asking for “justice for Izu”, a man who reportedly killed
        himself over a rape allegation. Currently, the post has 5 likes and 461
        comments, the majority of which are highschoolers expressing their
        disgust with the account. Unprogressive accounts and sentiments like
        this will not cause the students of Piedmont to forget the incident
        involving John and Stephen, nor will it cause anyone to forget any of
        the other accounts that are uploaded daily to the piedmontprotectors
        Instagram page. This is not an anomaly and the wealthy of Piedmont will
        continue to abuse their power until their misdeeds are made public and
        they are forced to pay for all the damage they have done.
