            Piedmont's racist history and racist present
          </div>

          <div class="article">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From an outsider’s perspective, it’s clear
            that Piedmont is a racist city. In the past few years, hate crimes
            against our Muslim community have gone unprosecuted, lawn jockeys
            have remained on display in multiple peoples’ front yards, and a
            previously-homeless black couple were continually harassed by their
            new neighbors and had the police called on them many times when they
            moved into piedmont. The present racist state of Piedmont is not
            new. Piedmont was initially a resort community for the wealthy who
            lived nearby. Anyone who’s been to Piedmont Park and read the
            various signs would know about this point in history. Piedmont
            became a city after the San Francisco earthquake in 1906 which
            caused many poor people and many people of color to enter Oakland
            (and Piedmont) looking for a new place to live. The wealthy whites
            living in Piedmont voted to become a separate city from Oakland,
            wanting to preserve their wealth and wanting to keep their
            neighborhood white. What we don’t have signs for in Piedmont Park is
            the history of people of color in Piedmont nor are we taught this
            bloody history in our schools.
            <br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first black family in Piedmont was the
            Dearing family. The family of four moved into Piedmont in 1924 at 67
            Wildwood Avenue. The police chief, Burton Becker who also was the
            leader of the local Ku Klux Klan chapter, refused to protect the
            Dearing Family and the police stood by as the Dearing Family’s home
            was firebombed three times by a mob of over 500
            white-supremacist-piedmont-citizens (no doubt the mob included
            police members). Area descriptions from this time state that
            Piedmont didn’t allow “negros, undesirables, and foreign-born
            people” from purchasing a home in Piedmont. The only people
            permitted were “executives, professionals, and white-collar workers”
            who made between 6,000 and 100,000 yearly (about 100,000 to 1.5
            million yearly in today’s dollar). Unfortunately, the attempt of
            many of the racist and classist people who were making decisions
            then are lasting. The average income in Piedmont is within the
            bounds set up in 1922 (adjusted for inflation), while Oaklands is ⅓
            of that number. Piedmont was only 1.3% black in the 2010 census.
            <br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any student of color will tell you that
            they’ve faced racial discrimination while attending Piedmont
            schools. Obviously, racism isn’t just a Piedmont issue, but the
            community here certainly fosters racism. Personally, I’ve been
            called many names that I won’t repeat here, and I’ve experienced
            many instances of racism without directly being called a slur. When
            I walk into Piedmont I immediately notice that there aren’t any
            homeless people around, that nearly every face I see is white. The
            experience is truly unsettling especially because the second you
            re-enter Oakland, you see homeless encampments left and right
            instead of multi-million dollar mansions with shiny new Teslas
            parked in front and an army of non-white immigrants working away at
            some shrubbery. <br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But again, how do we break down the
            barriers created by the wealthy of Piedmont in the 1920s, the
            barriers that are continually held up by the wealthy of Piedmont
            today? I believe the solution is to work towards pushing Oakland and
            Piedmont back together. Piedmont’s existence as a separate entity
            from Oakland only promotes the awful things most white rich Piedmont
            Liberals claim to be against. Nowadays, much of the bigotry that
            happens in Piedmont isn’t violently enforced (it sometimes is
            though), instead, it gets enforced by acts of racism going
            unpunished, by the community and the city constantly turning a blind
            eye to injustice, by modern-day redlining, and it is enforced by the
            hundred-year-old barrier between Oakland and Piedmont.
