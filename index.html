            “And the crippled and dead fall there and there new lives are
            prepared to fill their place and in the great deep graves men pack
            full with bodies and the masters, the Caesars play chess.”
            <br /><br />-Shlomo Shmulevitz, “Mentshn-freser” <br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advent of distance learning in the
            light of the current pandemic, new problems arise in pedagogy. How
            can teachers enforce the maintenance of academic integrity ie. to
            prevent cheating, to prevent plagiarism, and et cetera. We have
            already seen the decline of academic integrity in the final semester
            of the last school year; people communicating with their phones,
            watching TV shows when they are in class, people not paying
            attention in class. We have also witness the teachers’ pathetic
            reaction, of which includes the imperative that we must turn on our
            camera so that they may surveil us[1].<br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One solution some within the current
            government have proposed is a return to in- person classes,
            clamoring about the dire need to educate children, as if it were a
            self-evident sine qua non. Our school has already decided to
            continue distance-learning for at least the first semester of the
            next school year, however the possibility remains.<br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This solution is an existential threat to
            us, and an alternative solution must be found and so that we may
            both “Achieve the honorable” and be safe and healthy. However this
            is not of our concern, in fact what is most beneficial to us, the
            students, is that no solution exist, where academic integrity is
            unenforceable and cheating and procrastination is made easier.<br /><br />
            “At this point, a Sophist, Thrasymachos, enters and denounces all of
            the debaters as milky-eyed idealists. In reality, he says, all talk
            of “justice” is mere political pretext, designed to justify the
            interests of the powerful. And so it should be, because insofar as
            justice exists, it is simply that.” <br /><br />-David Graeber, Debt
            pg.196 <br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In no way in the perspective of a student[2]
            is academic integrity a desideratum. By cheating if done
            successfully and without detection their scores and grades improve.
            There is no real reason students should not cheat, except it is
            “morally” wrong to do so, ie. against academic integrity. The
            concept of academic integrity like many things is a social
            construct. Its creation does not benefit the student, if so we must
            ask, in the words of Shlomo Shmulevitz poem, mentshn-freser[3],
            “What agent do you serve?”<br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what reasons should students actually
            care about the accuracy of test scores of students and student
            participation in class? Whatever the reason is, it is not the
            students’ concern, who only wishes to have good grades and escape
            from this prison.[4]<br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true beneficiaries of “Academic
            Integrity” are not the students, who have the most to “gain” from
            it, but the capitalist system and its apparatus the state; there is
            nothing intrinsically “good” or “moral” about an educated citizenry.
            It is just that the masters of the world find it convenient that
            their respective citizens are loyal and educated on self-evident
            subjects, such as “History”,“Economics”, “Civics”, Math, and the
            national language.<br /><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the era of the Coronavirus, however, we
            might very well witness the death of academic integrity and a drift
            away from what Paulo Frerie calls “The banking concept of
            education”, and we must fight against its preservation, as our
            leaders would eagerly pay in our own blood for its affirmation.<br /><br />

            prisons, both often are designed by the same people. <br /><br />
